# DAA-Sorting-Algorithms-Analysis!
The followinng is a small analysis of the selected 3 sorting algorithms(Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort)

The graph showing the performance of the different sorting algorithms

By the information above in the graph I would say the selection sort is the best of the three sorting 
algorithms because it seems as n increases the time reduces
